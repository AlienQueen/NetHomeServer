Java
scheduling library that is simple and small, but still supports ringing
alarms at specified intervals, as one-time events, or on complex
schedules with full cron-like control.&nbsp; See below for a full list

written by Oliver Dedieu (other contributors: David Sims, Simon
B&eacute;cot, and Jim Lerner), and released
under the LGPL license.&nbsp; I needed a simple scheduling library, so
I fixed some bugs in it and added a lot
of features that I wanted (including rewriting the scheduling code to
support full cron flexibility).&nbsp; I've tried to send my changes
back to Oliver, but he didn't respond, and the project homepage has
disappeared (I think Oliver has moved on to bigger and better things),
so I'm hosting my version here.&nbsp; There are many other scheduling
tools available that you can use in your Java projects.&nbsp; In
comparison, JDRing is quite simple to use and very compact (the jar is
only 24K), plus it provides all of the scheduling features and
flexibility that most projects need. </td>

                  <ul>
                    <li>Alarms are added to and removed from the
schedule in code -- no file formats or XML schemas to learn.&nbsp; Just
call a method to add an alarm (and specify a listener that you define).</li>
                    <li>You can optionally specify a name for each
alarm; this lets you use a single listener for multiple alarms.&nbsp;
If you don't specify a name, JDRing automatically gives each alarm a
unique name.<br>
                    </li>
                    <li>Alarms can be rung at a fixed interval (e.g.,
every 30 minutes), or at a single fixed date (e.g., November 10th, 2004
at 10:15 AM), or on a cron-based flexible schedule.</li>
                    <li>With cron-style scheduling, you can provide a
list of minutes, hours, days of the month, days of the week, and months
(or "all" for any of these), and the alarm will ring on every
match.&nbsp; For example, you could ring an alarm on every half-hour
from 9am through 2pm, Monday through Thursday, in only the summer
months.&nbsp; The list would be like this: minutes: 0, 30; hours:
9,10,11,12,13,14; days of week: 1,2,3,4; days of month: all; months:
5,6,7.</li>
                    <li>Counting standards are consistent with the <code>java.utils.Calendar</code>
class, so minutes range from 0 to 59, hours from 0 to 23, days of the
week from 1 (Sunday) to 7, and days of the month from 1 to 31
(depending on the month).&nbsp; Months are not as you might expect,
though -- they go from 0 (Jan) to 11 (December).</li>
                    <li>When days of week and days of month are both
specified in a cron-style schedule, the alarm is rung when <i>either
one</i> matches (this is how cron works as well).&nbsp; For example, an
alarm with minutes: 0; hours: 6; days of week: 2,3; days of month:
1,15; and months: all.&nbsp; This alarm will ring at 6am on every
Monday and Tuesday, plus on the first and fifteenth of the month (well,
if the first is a Monday, it will ring once on that day).<br>
                    </li>
                    <li>Alarms by default are rung (listeners are
notified) within a single alarm thread, so a long-running alarm will
delay following alarms until it completes.&nbsp; This may be what you
want -- because alarm tasks may be dependant on previous ones.&nbsp; If
not, any alarm may be flagged to ring in a seperate thread, so that it
will not delay the other alarms.<br>
                    </li>
