/**
 * This is a simple example of a HomeItem. It demonstrates how to receive and send events.
 * Events are used to inform other Items about events that have occurred in the system.
 * One example of that is the "minute event" that the server sends once every minute and which can be
 * used for simple time keeping without having to create a timer in the Item.
 *
 * Note that the class is annotated as a "Plugin" which makes it possible for the NetHomeServer to load it
 * dynamically. All you have to do is to pack the class in a jar and place the jar in the "plugins" folder.
